# BMPL

BMPL (Builder's Multi-Purpose Language) is a planned language for many programmers out there, supporting general-purpose, OOP, web design and scripting and app production.

## Current production:

We are on the works on making the compiler (or interpreter) and the general-purpose part of BMPL. We'll be making as much functions and stuff we want to mak the language more presentable.

## We're looking for contributors.

That's right. We're looking for coders out there who can help build the language with pull requests and work with us developing the language.
