# BPML
BPML (Basic Program Mechanism Language) is a alternate, easier and simpler version of C that takes in certain functions from C, Python and Java. It is not object-oriented though it still takes in classes and structs. It also has syntax relating to C++, Python and Lua.

## A (planned) simple "Hello, world." program:
```
use "basic.lib"

function main():
    sayLn("Hello, world.");
}
```
